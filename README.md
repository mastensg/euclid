gathering 2013](http://www.pouet.net/party.php?which=43&when=2013) demo
competition.

it placed 5th (last) in the competition.

there is an entry on [pouet](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=61281) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXl-sByu4rg) on youtube.

this demo was developed on a thinkpad x60s, which only supported up to opengl 1.3.
